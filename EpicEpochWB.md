# **World Bank:** Epic Epoch

### **Results & Interpretation**

We observe many things in this epic epoch output that we also discuss in our interpretation of demography. Obviously, **'development'** is from the very beginning the most frequently used item and remains in this position throughout the years. Other words like **'power'** seem to be relevant only in the first ten years. After 1960, it becomes rarely used and rather insignificant. Some words like **'project'** remain in the focus of the World Bank a bit longer because this item is tightly linked to the work the World Bank carries out. 'Project' was the second most used word after 'development' in the 1970s and early 1980s, but was later surpassed by **'policy'** and **'growth'**. Both items remained very central to the annual reports during the early 1990s and 'policy' continued to be used frequently while 'growth' turned out to be only a momentary focus. It is possible that the World Bank started to see economic growth as only one goal among several important goals and the item was therefore used less frequently.

We also observe that words that are centered around a rather **technical and financial approach** to development feature prominently in the first reports, but lose their importence steadily during the following decades. These words include 'industrialization', 'capital' and 'plant'. The only word from this group that was still widely used in the last annual reports is **'investment'**. Investment seems to be just so central to the work of the World Bank in providing loans and supporting FDI that it remained one of the most frequently used items throughout the decades.

Other words only emerge in the later decades. Many of them stand for a more **humanitarian and social approach** to development and the guidance of globalization. They represent a shift in the focus of the World Bank. This group of items includes 'poverty', 'poor', 'health' and 'social' amongst others.

Maybe due too the **global financial crisis** in 2007/2008 and its aftermath, words like 'risk', 'credit' and 'market' feature prominently in the last five annual reports. This could indicate a comparatively sudden increase of attention towards these topics and how the financial crisis affected global economic and social development. Due to globalization, these kind of crises leave no country completely unaffected.
