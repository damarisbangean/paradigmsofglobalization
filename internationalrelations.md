# **International Relations**
 
Here we explore geopolitcal relations between countries through a network map, particularly using the World Bank reports. We use the same edited list of country names that we used in our epic epochs to run this analysis. 

Moreover, we divide our network maps into three different period slices so that we can see changing geopolitical relations *over time*. 


By visualizing how countries move and shift between clusters (or form entirely new ones) over time, we can thus, to a degree, observe changing geopolitical relations over time. 


## **1946-1968**

In this first network map, we notice that the countries tend to by grouped by their development status, without much respect for their actual region. This is indicative of the World Bank's rather simplistic approach of predominantly grouping countries by economic criteria at the time. 

However, as we know, many issues of poverty that the World Bank seeks to address are indeed, to an extent, a product of their shared histories (and often, shared experienes of external intervention particularly by colonial or hegemonic powers). Indeed, it was from 1945 that the process of [decolonization in Africa](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/asia-and-africa) began, and guiding the peaceful transitions from colonial to self-governing (though not always democratic) rule was a [foremost objective of the UN](http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/decolonization/) since its founding.



## **1969-1990**

Here, we notice that the countries are much more clearly categorized into regional groupings. 

## 1991-2012

Finally, our last network map delineats the distinctions between regions, and also indicates some outstanding geopolitical developments. 

Particularly, notice the "explosion" of countries that came after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Suddenly, after the Communist Revolutions from 1989-1992 we have an entirely new cluster of countries that came to the fore in the wake of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)!
