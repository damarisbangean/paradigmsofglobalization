# World Bank Demography


## Results & Interpretation

We offer some insights and analysis but you can use the graph below to draw your own conclusions. As long as all words are included the display is rather difficult to interpret, but you can choose which items to display by clicking on the sign next to them. Additionally, you can switch between different designs of display.

First of all, **'globalization'** seems to be a rather recent term. It is mentioned in 1995 for the very first time. And the World Bank doesn't use it very often. It peaked in 2001 and 2002 with a frequency of nine. This could indicate that the World Bank reports more on specific projects and loans it was working on or issued during the previous year instead of being concerned with globalization as a whole. The concept of globalization is comparatively new even though we now talk about waves of globalization that go back to the 19th century. 'Globalization' was first used in an economic sense in the early 1980s.

Other concepts that don't go back to the first reports are **'policy'** and **'governance'**. The World Bank started to use the word 'policy' a lot more frequently since the early 1980s. In 1959 policy was mentioned only once by the World Bank, but it later peaked with a frequency of 307 in 1992. 'Governance' was used for the first time in 1990 and was mentioned only once. It later peaked at 83 in 1999. Afterwards it declined again to a frequency of 4 in 2012. The focus of the World Bank on governance during the 1990s could be connected to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the effort to establish new regimes and working systems in the former Soviet republics.

In regard to **environment**, we observe an interesting pattern. Many words related to environment like 'sustainable', 'forest', 'pollution', 'ecosystem' and 'environment' seemed to be a focus of the World Bank from the late 1980s until the early 2000s. Since then, all these words are mentioned less often or not at all. Only 'climate' is mentioned more often since the early 2000s with a frequency of 50 in 2003 and a frequency of 52 in 2009.

Concerning our **research questions**, many words we expected to be used more are rather uncommon: 'trade barriers' or 'financial assistance' aren't mentioned more than 10 times in one report. Sometimes they aren't mentioned at all. More frequently used terms are 'investment', 'debt', 'capital' or 'credit'. 'Investment' has been used since the 1980s and is used rather constantly with a frequency between 100 and 150, even though its usage declined since after 2009.

We observe that a more **technical side** of development started to loose its importance to the World Bank in the early 1990s. 'Industrialization' and 'technical assistance' were both constantly used since the 1970s and peaked in the early 1980s. But since the early 1990s, while this technical and economical side became less of a focus, other words that point in a more **social direction** became more frequent. There is nearly no mention of words like 'social', 'poor', 'poverty', 'women' or 'gender' before 1970. They started to get used more frequently in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 'Social' was for example mentioned 40 times in 1978, but 292 times in 1999. Other words in this social realm went through a similar evolution.
