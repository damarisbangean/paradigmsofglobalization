# **Demography: United Nations & World Bank**


### **Methodology**

While exploring our data, we ran it through the [Demography](https://docs.cortext.net/demography/) script on CorText. Demography processes each field of the corpus and counts the raw evolution of occurrences of the top items. We used the "temporal evolution directory" where each field of the corpus will be enumerated over time in a csv file compiling the occurrences at each time step of the top items of the given field (original count of occurrences). We then used the "normalisation" option on CorText, as the reports included in our corpus were of varying magnitudes. 

We analysed the evolution of our predetermined list of key items in the reports of the United Nations from 1947 till 2011 and in our reports of the World Bank from 1946 to 2012.

### **Analysis of Demography Graphs**

We offer some insights and analysis here, but you can use the graphs below to draw your own conclusions. As long as all words are included the display is rather difficult to interpret, but you can choose which items to display by clicking on the sign next to them. Additionally, you can switch between different designs of display.

### **United Nations:** Results & Interpretation
The top terms in our demography are as follows:

From this demography process, we can see that the evolution of terms over 1947 till 2011 shows the change in focus of the UN. The United Nations was founded with the objective of maintaining international peace, and to foster friendly relations among nations. Terms such as **war**, **peace** and **exploitation** were more frequently used in the 1950s. War for instance appeared with a frequency of 1026 in 1947 wheareas by 2011 it declined to a frequency of 1.

Other terms that were frequently employed throughout the reports were **tariffs**, **technical assistance** and **taxation** in the earlier "second wave" of globalisation. This was a period when the focus on development was more **technical**. It was also a period where the prime focus was on economic growth rather than development. It was during the second phase of globalisation that the Asian Tiger economies reached their peak. 

The shift in focus towards a more social and humanitarian approach was in the 1990's where terms like **sustainable development**, appeared for the first time 1988. Other terms like **climate**, **health**, **renewable** and **environment** were also terms that appeared more frequently only post the 1970s. The term renewable had a frequency of only 2 in 1947 but by 2011 it reached a frequency of 76. The term environment had a frequency of only 2 in 1953 but reached a frequency of 76 by 2011. This is line with what we expected as environmental movements gained momentum only after the SMIC Conference (Study of Man's Impact on Climate) reported the danger of rapid and serious global change caused by humans. 

Even terms like **innovation** and **technology** appeared more frequently only in the third wave of globalisation. Innovation appeared for the first time only in 1958 and technology in 1947 had a frequency of 2 and it peaked in 2011 with a frequency of 229. 

Some terms like **migration**, **women** and **multilateral** appear with somewhat the same frequency throughout both the waves of globalisation.

It is also interesting to note that the term **globalization** which was coined in the 1980s appeared for the first time only in the UN annual report of 1988. With a frequency of 2 in 1988 it reached a frequency of 22 by 1990 and in 2010 had a frequnecy of 59. Thus, it is a term whose frequency has been increasing over time.



### **World Bank:** Results & Interpretation


First of all, **'globalization'** seems to be a rather recent term. It is mentioned in 1995 for the very first time. And the World Bank doesn't use it very often. It peaked in 2001 and 2002 with a frequency of nine. This could indicate that the World Bank reports more on specific projects and loans it was working on or issued during the previous year instead of being concerned with globalization as a whole. The concept of globalization is comparatively new even though we now talk about waves of globalization that go back to the 19th century. 'Globalization' was first used in an economic sense in the early 1980s.

Other concepts that don't go back to the first reports are **'policy'** and **'governance'**. The World Bank started to use the word 'policy' a lot more frequently since the early 1980s. In 1959 policy was mentioned only once by the World Bank, but it later peaked with a frequency of 307 in 1992. 'Governance' was used for the first time in 1990 and was mentioned only once. It later peaked at 83 in 1999. Afterwards it declined again to a frequency of 4 in 2012. The focus of the World Bank on governance during the 1990s could be connected to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the effort to establish new regimes and working systems in the former Soviet republics.

In regard to **environment**, we observe an interesting pattern. Many words related to environment like 'sustainable', 'forest', 'pollution', 'ecosystem' and 'environment' seemed to be a focus of the World Bank from the late 1980s until the early 2000s. Since then, all these words are mentioned less often or not at all. Only 'climate' is mentioned more often since the early 2000s with a frequency of 50 in 2003 and a frequency of 52 in 2009.

Concerning our **research questions**, many words we expected to be used more are rather uncommon: 'trade barriers' or 'financial assistance' aren't mentioned more than 10 times in one report. Sometimes they aren't mentioned at all. More frequently used terms are 'investment', 'debt', 'capital' or 'credit'. 'Investment' has been used since the 1980s and is used rather constantly with a frequency between 100 and 150, even though its usage declined since after 2009.

We observe that a more **technical side** of development started to loose its importance to the World Bank in the early 1990s. 'Industrialization' and 'technical assistance' were both constantly used since the 1970s and peaked in the early 1980s. But since the early 1990s, while this technical and economical side became less of a focus, other words that point in a more **social direction** became more frequent. There is nearly no mention of words like 'social', 'poor', 'poverty', 'women' or 'gender' before 1970. They started to get used more frequently in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 'Social' was for example mentioned 40 times in 1978, but 292 times in 1999. Other words in this social realm went through a similar evolution.
