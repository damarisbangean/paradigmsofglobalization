# Limitations and Problems with our project: 
While we tried to be thorough, unfortunately there were some issues that hindered our project's execution. 

# Initial problems 
- At first, we also wanted to include reports from the [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/about/), which is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 35 member countries, founded in 1960 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.
- However, unfortunately we could not access the OECD's reports to include in our analysis. 
- We also faced a challenge with the oldest UN reports, as the older copies of the reports were scans of hard copies, rendering them unreadable by Cortext. For the rest of the UN reports, we were able to resolve this issue by converting them from PDF files to TXT files. 
- Another limitation that we found particularly frustrating was that we couldn't change the color of the font for our top menu. We've received complaints about this from website visitors - who can read that, honestly? Perhaps it would be advisable to contact the Github theme creators... or figure out how to properly code it ourselves if possible. 


# Missing Data:
- The corpus for the United Nations is composed of 49 items (61.3 MB) because 1949-1951, 1961 1964, 1968, 1991-1998 and 2004 reports could not be found.
