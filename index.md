# **PARADIGMS OF GLOBALIZATION**

In the last 150 years, the world has experienced three "waves of globalization" characterised by increased international integration: the 50 years preceding World War I, the quarter of a century after World War II, and the present time. Technology evolved, political leadership changed, trade was liberalized and services became a third important sector of the economy besides the extraction of raw materials as a primary economic sector and manufacturing as a secondary sector. Capital started to move more freely and foreign direct investment as well as development aid became important drivers of prosperity. People started to migrate more freely and many countries experienced labor as well as political migration.

Globalization manifested itself very differently around the world and not every country profited from more integration and open borders. Some countries were able to catch up while others fell even further behind. Some countries found a global market for their products and became important exporting nations, while others accumulated huge import surpluses. Every wave of globalization was followed by a backlash in the form of rising protectionism and isolationism.

Still, globalization remains an ambiguous term and its maining and manifestation may have changed during the waves of globalization the world has experienced so far. International organisations shape and drive globalization because they are global rule and standard setters and are deeply involved with supporting sustainable development and building a more prosperous world for everybody. Following World War II, two of the major international organizations that essentially embody the process of globalization came into being: the World Bank (1944) and the United Nations (1945).

These two organizations have different missions, different political scopes and a different approach to promoting and shaping globalization. We want to find out how their approaches differ, how their understanding of globalization and its paradigms has changed over time and where we are now.

**Please feel free to browse this website and discover our results on the following pages.**

On this homepage you are able to read more about our methodology, our sources and our approach. But, let's have a look at what our two international organizations do and how they differ first!

# **World Bank**
- **Mission:** ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity

In this short video World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim outlines three pillars that will drive momentum toward ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity.

# **Our Research Project**

We looked at the second and third wave of globalization and wanted to find out if and how the perspective on globalization has changed. The World Bank and the UN are both important drivers of globalization and development. Has their approach to globalization changed?

Below you can find our research questions, our data sets and the tests we ran.


## **Research Questions**

- **Question 1:** Have the topics of interest of the United Nations and World Bank changed between the second and the third wave of globalization?
- H0: No change can be observed. 
- H1: There is a perceptible change between the second and third wave of globalization.

- **Question 2:** If so, has the focus on international organizations changed from a pure economic focus to more a social economic focus? 
- H0: The observed change can not be interpreted as a shift from pure economic to social economic. 
- H1: A change is observable from a purely economic focus (second wave) to a social economic focus (third wave).

## **Corpus** 

We habe worked with Annual Reports by the World Bank (1946-2012) and Annual Reports by the United Nations (1945-2011). Unfortunately, some reports by the UN are missing for certain years. You can read more about this in our **Limitations**. We had to convert the the UN reports into txt - files in order to work with them in CorText. Some reports were diviided into several documents and had to be merged. In the end, we worked with 49 UN files and 66 World Bank files.

We analysed the corpus by using a list of key words called terms list. We extracted a terms list from our corpus, but the initial results were unsastifactory and didn't advance our research interest. To address our research questions, we decided to create our own terms list. We developed a terms list based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
