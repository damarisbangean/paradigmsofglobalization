# **PARADIGMS OF GLOBALIZATION**

In the last 150 years, the world has experienced three **"waves of globalization"** characterised by increased international integration: the 50 years preceding World War I, the quarter of a century after World War II, and the present time. Technology evolved, political leadership changed, trade was liberalized and services became a third important sector of the economy besides the extraction of raw materials as a primary economic sector and manufacturing as a secondary sector. Capital started to move more freely and foreign direct investment as well as development aid became important drivers of prosperity. People started to migrate more freely and many countries experienced labor as well as political migration.

Globalization manifested itself very differently around the world and not every country has profited from more integration and open borders. Some countries were able to catch up while others fell even further behind. Some countries found a global market for their products and became important exporting nations, while others accumulated huge import surpluses. Every wave of globalization was followed by a backlash in the form of rising **protectionism and isolationism**.

Still, globalization remains an ambiguous term and its naming and manifestation may have changed during the waves of globalization the world has experienced so far. In all of this, **international organisations** shape and drive globalization because they are global rule and standard setters and are deeply involved with supporting sustainable development and building a more prosperous world for everybody. Following World War II, two of the major international organizations that essentially embody the process of globalization came into being: the **[World Bank (1944)](http://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are)** and the **[United Nations (1945)](http://www.un.org/en/about-un/index.html)**.




These two organizations have different missions, different political scopes and a different approach to promoting and shaping globalization. **We want to find out how their approaches differ, how their understanding of globalization and its paradigms has changed over time and where we are now.**

Please feel free to browse this website, discover our results on the following pages and give us some feedback on your experience.

On this homepage you are able to read more about our methodology, our sources and our approach. So, keep reading if you are interested in these details of our research project. Otherwise, you can choose a different page and dive right into our results and interpretation. 

But, let's have a look at what these two international organizations do and how they differ first!

## **World Bank**

The [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) was created in 1944 as one of the **Bretton Woods institutions** together with the International Monetary Fund. It is therefore an international financial institution and provides loans to countries for capital programs and has currently 189 member states. The World Bank comprises the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). Its mission is the **ending of extreme poverty** and building shared prosperity. But, it is also committed to the achieve these goals through the **promotion of foreign direct investment and the liberalization of international trade**.

If you prefer to listen to an explanation: Here is a short video of the **World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim** talking about the three pillars that will drive momentum toward ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity.

## **United Nations** 


The [United Nations]( is probably the most well known international organization. They were founded in 1945 as a collective answer to World War II. They currently have 193 member states. The mission and the work of the UN are guided by the purposes and principles contained in its founding Charter. The UN's main goal is maintaining **international peace and security**, but they work in many different fields. They also work towards achieving international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character. One part of this international cooperation were the Millennium Development Goals that were replaced by the **Sustainable Development Goals** in 2015. These goals include for example the fight against poverty and hunger. In working towards sustainable development for all countries, the UN is trying to make sure that globalization works for everyone.

As we can see, the UN covers a **broader range of topics** compared to the World Bank. They have a more **humanitarian and social outlook** and don't have an underlying interest in promoting FDI or free trade.

If you want to learn more about the UN, this short video gives you an impression of the scope of the UN's work.

# **Our Research Project**

We looked at the second and third wave of globalization and wanted to find out if and how the perspective on globalization has changed. The World Bank and the UN are both important drivers of globalization and development. **Has their understanding of globalization and their approach in managing the impact of globalization changed throughout the years?**

Below you can find out more about our research design. You can read our research questions, learn more about our data sets and the tests we ran.


## **Research Questions**

**Question 1:** Have the topics of interest of the United Nations and World Bank changed between the second and the third wave of globalization?
- **H0:** No change can be observed. 
- **H1:** There is a perceptible change between the second and third wave of globalization.

**Question 2:** If so, has the focus on international organizations changed from a pure economic focus to a more social economic focus? 
- **H0:** The observed change can not be interpreted as a shift from pure economic to social economic. 
- **H1:** A change is observable from a purely economic focus (second wave) to a social economic focus (third wave).

## **Tests & Analysis**

- Demography
- Epic Epoch
- Network Mapping


## **Corpus** 

We have worked with Annual Reports by the World Bank (1946-2012) and Annual Reports by the United Nations (1945-2011). Unfortunately, some reports by the UN are missing for certain years. You can read more about this in our **[Limitations](Limitations.md) **. We had to convert the UN reports from (.pdf) into (.txt) files in order to work with them in CorText.  Two details were important at this point: some reports were divided into several documents and had to be merged. Names of the files should be simple, in order to allow cortex to identify and associate terms with specific years. 

The World Bank Corpus was much easier to acquire and work with as compared to the UN corpus. We were able to find Annual Reports from  1946 to 2012. The World Bank data is more uniform in terms of the format of the reports (the fact that they have been called ‘Annual Reports’ right from the beginning).

In the end, we worked with 49 UN files and 66 World Bank files.

## From an Initial Terms Extraction to a Proposed Terms List

We analysed the corpus by using a list of key words called terms list. We extracted a terms list from our corpus, but the initial results were unsastifactory and didn't advance our research interest. To address our research questions, we decided to create our own terms list. We developed a terms list based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
