# PARADIGMS OF GLOBALIZATION

In the last 150 years, the world has experienced three "waves of globalization" characterised by increased international integration: the 50 years preceding World War I, the quarter of a century after World War II, and the present time.

Following World War II, two of the major international organizations that essentially embody the process of globalization came into being: the World Bank (1944) and the United Nations (1945). 

Let's have a look at what these organizations do!

# World Bank

# Our Research Project

We looked at the second and third wave of globalization and wanted to find out if and how the perspective on globalization has changed. The World Bank and the UN are both important drivers of globalization and development. Has their approach to globalization changed?

Below you can find our research questions, our data sets and the tests we ran.
