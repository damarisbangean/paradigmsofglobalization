# **Key Terms Frequency** 

### **Comparison between the World Bank and the United Nations**

For this section we chose five words to see in more detail the differences between in the UN and WB globalization approach during the second and the third wave of globalization. From our term list, we chose two words that were representative of both waves. Our hypothesis, is that during the second wave of globalization, international organizations had a more "economic and trade" approach, and during the third wave, social and distributive subjects took the lead in the discussion. 

Second wave terms: "Trade" and "Private Sector"
Third wave terms: "Poverty" and "Health"

Finally, we also include a fifth term that we noticed during the analysis of the data: a new topic arose as one of the most mentioned in the reports from both organizations "climate". Discussi√≥n about global warming, CO2, climate change, sea level and, in general, dangers derived from big scale industry, has become one of the main characters of the conceptualization of development in the latest years. 

In general, we can see that the UN is always some years behind the WB in terms of including new concepts in their reports. The WB has the lead in the development determinant analysis. 


*It is important to note in the graphs below that they are not exactly to scale for each international organization. Notice that the values on the y-axis differ between graphs. However, as we are looking for the relative frequency of a term within an organization's report, we particularly look for the the trend - and, in particular, the years - when these terms began to figure more prominently in the organizations' reports. 



# Trade
International trade has undoubtedly shaped the economic performance and wealth of the world. 

Even if a wealthier world does not necessarily means more equity or a better quality of life for everybody, it is the first condition before thinking on redistribution issues. 

According to the graphs presented below, frequency of term "trade" moved along with economic cycles of the second half of the XXth century.
For the UN, it reached a pick in the reports during the second wave of globalization, between 1960 and 1966, during the Bretton Woods order. 

It is important to notice that during this period, even if there were serious controls to capital movements, GDPs' of industrialized 
countries grew massively due to increases in international trade. 
For the WB, it reached its' highest peak during the third wave of globalization between 1980 and 1995. This period is characterized by 
great instability due to the first oil shock that affected the whole world economy and to the debt crisis in Latin America that led to 
changes in the international trade structure, such as Industrialization by Substitution of Imports.
In that sense, it can be stated that both organizations had different approaches to trade. For the UN, trade may be a 
development and industrialization strategy for developing countries, since during the debt crisis it was less mentioned. For the WB, trade 
may be more related with international trade, since its frequency seems to be more related with the world economic cycles.

# **Private sector**
As the role of the private sector has become more important during the last three decades, through new managerial approaches, for the WB
the concept "private sector" reached its' highest peak during the 90s and has decreased since the 2000. Financial crises of the beginning of the 20th century may have been a motive for it. For the UN, it reached its' highest peak during the internet crisis of the 2002.

# **Poverty**
According to our hypothesis, international agencies such as the World Bank and the UN had a more purely "economic approach" during 
the first half of the 20th century. But in the second half, they indeed became more focused on the economic *and social* well-being of individuals around the world.

The frequency of the word "Poverty" over time seems to prove us right, because for both the World Bank and the United Nations, it begins to be very important during the third wave of globalization. However, it is important to notice that it started to be more present in the World Bank annual reports during the 80's, but for the UN it was not until the year 2000. 

It was exactly the year 2000 when the United Nations launched its [Millenium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) and indeed began to focus on development and by adopted the primary goal of [eradicating extreme poverty](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml) and hunger. 

- The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.
- More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1990.
- In 1990, nearly half of the population in the developing regions lived on less than $1.25 a day. This rate dropped to 14 per cent in 2015.

These which goals, which were initally targeted to be achieved by the year 2015, maintained their foremeost position in the Sustainable Development Goals that replaced the MDG's in 2015. Yet despite these ambitious goals, both in the orginal MDGs and the later SGDs, at the global level today, more than 800 million people are still living in extreme poverty.

# **Health**
The term "health" is another example of our hypothesis of the rising prevalence of social issues during the third wave of globalization. 
However, in this case, the World Bank first started to mention it a lot during the 1970's, three decades before the UN, where it reached its highest peak only the year 2000.

Nevertheless, in both cases, it is more frequent during the last 30 years of the 20th century, providing a reason that supports our hypothesis.

"Health" simply as itself as a term proves to be quite problematic to analyze by its mere frequency in the texts, as "health" actually comprises a lot of different aspects and associated terms that *relate to health* but do not **explicity** mention the word health. 
This is best exemplified by how the United Nations' initial 2000 Millenium Developments Goals were framed: 

- **Goal 4:** [Reduce child mortality](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/childhealth.shtml)
- **Goal 5:** [Improve maternal health](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml)
- **Goal 6:** [Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/aids.shtml)


All of these goals, while all directed towards generally *improving health* were made all the more coherent and cohesive by [Goal 3](https://www.google.fr/search?q=united+nations+sustainable+development+goals+health&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS701US701&oq=united+nations+health+sus&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.6102j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of the Sustainable Development Goals, which simply aimed to: 

> Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

This added clarity is essential to helping the United Nations set attainable targets and create measurements by which to track its progres made on the goal. Indeed, the SDG for ensuring healthly lives literally combines **_all three_** of the former goals related to health under this one "umbrella" of health, and has these exact top three [goals]: 

- By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births
- By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births
- By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases




# **Climate**
As mentioned before, not only were *social* issues were important during the third wave of globalization, but the arrival towards a more holistic view of development in general led to the increasing attention towards of other pressing global isseus, such as climate.

This further proves the deep generational shift of perspective that occurred during the second half of the 20th century for the World Bank and the United Nations in terms of public policy, priorities and development strategies.

In 2000, the United Nations set out the following goals regarding climate change and ensuring [environmental sustainability](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/environ.shtml): 
- Integrate the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes and reverse the loss of environmental resources
- Reduce biodiversity loss, achieving, by 2010, a significant reduction in the rate of loss
- Halve, by 2015, the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation
- Achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers

- ** Notice that these goals themselves do not all immediately appear to be directly related to the environment and climate change itself. This is one of the reasons why the Millenium Development Goals underwent a thorough revision to clarify each one their aims and categorize them more appropriately.**   

However, discussion about climate is strictly related to industrialization policies, trade, natural ressources and big scale industry. So the rise of this new topic is the rise of the discussin about the consequences of policies related to development, wealth and trade that we had during the XXth century.
