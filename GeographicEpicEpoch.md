# Geographic Analysis: Prominent Countries Over Time 

### **United Nations: Geographic Analysis**

We want to find which countries are talked about most frequently in the reports so that we can know which countries receive the most attention or play the greatest role in these organizations. This can help us identify key world players, developing areas, and possibly even relationships between them (to be discussed more on our next page on international relations). 

Here, we run an [Epic Epoch](https://docs.cortext.net/epic-epoch/) on Cortext to analyze the most frequently occuring country names in the United Nations and World Bank reports over time.  

First, we run a  [Name Entity Recognizer](https://docs.cortext.net/named-entity-recognizer/) on the corpus to extract the most frequently occuring terms. We then "clean" the list by standardizing the country names to avoid double counting when they refer the same country (i.e. The United States, the US, the U.S. all become different recognizable forms of the "United States"). 

#### **Term List**

Here is our "clean" list of country names that we will use:

Once we have our "clean" list of country names, we run an Epic Epoch to see how individual countries have figured in the globalization's discourse over time.

From this geopolitical epic epoch analysis we can also see the evolution of world events such as:

- [India-Pakistan War in 1965](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/india-pakistan-war)
- [India-China Nathu La and Cho La clash in 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathu_La_and_Cho_La_clashes)
- [Arab-Israel 6 day war in 1967](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39960461)
- [Japanese asset price bubble between 1986 to 1991](http://www.thebubblebubble.com/japan-bubble/)

### **World Bank: Geographic Analysis**
Here are the most commonly occuring countries in the World Bank's World Economic and Social Survey reports from 1946 to 2015

Unsurprisingly, the US figures most prominently throughout the reports. But, smaller countries also rise and fall over time, as evidenced by major world events.  
- Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966
- Japan’s rise in 1990 at the start of its financial crisis
- Poland’s 1989 revolution against Communism
- Bosnian genocide 1995 
- West bank and Gaza 1993/1995 
- Bangladesh 2004 tsunami
- [Start of Arab spring December 2010](https://www.npr.org/2011/12/17/143897126/the-arab-spring-a-year-of-revolution)
