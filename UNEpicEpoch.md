# **Epic Epoch: United Nations & World Bank**

## **United Nations**

The Epic Epoch is a simple script for tracking dramatic changes in the composition of a field over time on CorText.
It acts in three steps:

1. The N most frequently occurring entities are selected at each time period,
2. A frequency timeline is built for each of the selected terms
3. A bump graph shows the evolution of frequency and ranking through time

Presented below is the epic epoch analysis for the UN corpus. 

Similar to our demography analysis, the we ran the epic epoch analysis for the data that was available between the years 1947 and 2011. 

The dip between 1990-2000, is due to missing data for that period.

The UN was founded following the Second World War, in 1945 with 50 nations with the aim of maintaining international peace and security after the world war. From this epic epoch analysis we can see that terms such as **"war"** which was frequently used in the 1950s faded out by the 1970s. 

Other words like **"industrialisation"**, **"exports"** and **"investment"** were more prominent in the second wave of globalization and faded out by the third wave. We can also see that **trade** and **investment** were terms that were frequently used in the annual reports of the 1960s. 

In the third wave of globalisation there is a change in the focus of the United Nations towards a more socioeconomic approach and terms such as **"health"**, **"development"**, **energy** and **"climate"** were frequently used. From a purely economic perspective of development the United Nations shifted its focus to also solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character.

From this geopolitical epic epoch analysis we can also see the evolution of world events such as:

- India-Pakistan War in 1965
- India-China Nathu La and Cho La clash in 1967
- Arab-Israel 6 day war in 1967
- Japanese asset price bubble between 1986 and 1991
- Fall of the Soviet of Soviet Union in 1991
- Martial Law in Poland in 1980
- Global Financial Crisis in 2007-2008


## **World Bank**

We observe many things in this epic epoch output that we also discuss in our interpretation of demography. Obviously, **'development'** is from the very beginning the most frequently used item and remains in this position throughout the years. Other words like **'power'** seem to be relevant only in the first ten years. After 1960, it becomes rarely used and rather insignificant. Some words like **'project'** remain in the focus of the World Bank a bit longer because this item is tightly linked to the work the World Bank carries out. 'Project' was the second most used word after 'development' in the 1970s and early 1980s, but was later surpassed by **'policy'** and **'growth'**. Both items remained very central to the annual reports during the early 1990s and 'policy' continued to be used frequently while 'growth' turned out to be only a momentary focus. It is possible that the World Bank started to see economic growth as only one goal among several important goals and the item was therefore used less frequently.

We also observe that words that are centered around a rather **technical and financial approach** to development feature prominently in the first reports, but lose their importence steadily during the following decades. These words include 'industrialization', 'capital' and 'plant'. The only word from this group that was still widely used in the last annual reports is **'investment'**. Investment seems to be just so central to the work of the World Bank in providing loans and supporting FDI that it remained one of the most frequently used items throughout the decades.

Other words only emerge in the later decades. Many of them stand for a more **humanitarian and social approach** to development and the guidance of globalization. They represent a shift in the focus of the World Bank. This group of items includes 'poverty', 'poor', 'health' and 'social' amongst others.

Maybe due too the **global financial crisis** in 2007/2008 and its aftermath, words like 'risk', 'credit' and 'market' feature prominently in the last five annual reports. This could indicate a comparatively sudden increase of attention towards these topics and how the financial crisis affected global economic and social development. Due to globalization, these kind of crises leave no country completely unaffected.

### **World Bank: Geographic Analysis**
Here we run an epic epoch on Cortext to analyze the most frequently occuring country names in the World Bank reports. 
First, we run a Name Entity Recognizer on the corpus to extract the most frequently occuring terms, and we standardize the list names to avoid double counting names when they might just be the same place (i.e. The United States, the US, the U.S. all become different recognizable forms of the "United States") 

Here is our "clean" list of country names that we will use: 

#### **Term List**

Once we have our "clean" list of country names, we run an Epic Epoch. 

An Epic Epoch is a simple script for tracking dramatic changes in the composition of a field over time. It acts in three steps:
- First, the N most frequently occurring entities are selected at each time period,
- A frequency timeline is built for each of the selected terms
- A bump graph shows the evolution of frequency and ranking through time


Unsurprisingly, the US figures most prominently throughout the reports. But, smaller countries also rise and fall over time, as evidenced by major world events.  
- Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966
- Japan’s rise in 1990 at the start of its financial crisis
- Poland’s 1989 revolution against Communism
- Bosnian genocide 1995 
- West bank and Gaza 1993/1995 
- Bangladesh 2004 tsunami
- Start of Arab spring December 2010
