Epic Epoch: United Nations

Methodology:

The Epic Epoch is a simple script for tracking dramatic changes in the composition of a field over time on CorText. Presneted below is the epic epoch analysis for the UN corpus. The dip between 1990-2000, is due to missing data for that period.

From this epic epoch analysis we can see that terms such as "war", "industrialisation", "exports" and "investment" were more prominent in the second wave of globalization and faded out by the third wave. Whereas terms such as "health", "development" and "climate" appear more often in the third wave of globalization. 

By looking at these terms, thus we can see the shift in the focus of the world over time.
