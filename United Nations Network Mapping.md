#Network Mapping: United Nations 

**There are five main nodes:
1. Industrialization and production
2. Globalization and risk
3. School and education
4. Health and children
5. Sustainable development and  Sustainable

The first two are more related with economic performance, wealth and industry. Terms that, according to our hypothesis, are more present in the second wave of globalization. 
The last three, make reference to social policies and redistributive strategies. Concepts that we believe that started to be more important during the third wave. 
However, school and education, globalization and risk, health and child care, and sustainable development seem to be closely related between them. It is important to notice that the term agriculture makes the link between the aforementioned issues and the node industrialization and production node, which can explain how agriculture and primary goods have been an important element of the development strategy of the non industrialized countries.

School and education nodes' most important word is growth, which is a clear indication of how education is interpreted as a redistribute policy and a tool to break poverty traps.

Industrialization and production node is a very "clasic" one with all the words from the "traditional" economic focus: industrialization, investment, capital, trade, exports, production, employment. However, it is important to notice the presence of words such as: War, India and China, that show at what extent those two countries were key players in the world economic performance during the second half of the XXth century, as well as how the war(s) defined and shaped industrialization history of the world.

What it is most important is the close relation between Globalization and risk; School and education and Sustainable development, thay are strictly related and is almost like they depend one on the other.
