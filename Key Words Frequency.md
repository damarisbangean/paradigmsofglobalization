# Key Words Frequency 

**Comparison between the World Bank and the United Nations**

# Trade
International trade has shaped economic performance and wealth of the world. 
Even if a wealthier world does not necessarily means more equity or a better quality of life for everybody, 
it is the first condition before thinking on redistribution issues. 
According to the graphs presented below, frequency of term "trade" moved along with economic cycles of the second half of the XXth century.
For the UN, it reached a pick in the reports during the second wave of globalization, between 1960 and 1966, during the Bretton Woods order. 
It is important to notice that during this period, even if there were serious controls to capital movements, GDPs' of industrialized 
countries grew massively due to increases in international trade. 
For the WB, it reached its' highest peak during the third wave of globalization between 1980 and 1995. This period is characterized by 
great instability due to the first oil shock that affected the whole world economy and to the debt crisis in Latin America that led to 
changes in the international trade structure, such as Industrialization by Substitution of Imports.
In that sense, it can be stated that both organizations had different approaches to trade. For the UN, trade may be a 
development and industrialization strategy for developing countries, since during the debt crisis it was less mentioned. For the WB, trade 
may be more related with international trade, since its frequency seems to be more related with the world economic cycles.

# Private sector
As the role of the private sector has become more important during the last three decades, through new managerial approaches, for the WB
the concept "private sector" reached its' highest peak during the 90s and has decreased since the 2000. Financial crises of the beginning 
of the XX century may have been a motive for it. For the UN, it reached its' highest peak during the internet crisis of the 2002.

# Poverty
According to our hypothesis, international agencies such as the WB and the UN had a more "economical approach" during 
the first half of the XXth century. But the second half, left more space for social and quality of life issues. 
The frequency of the word "Poverty" seems to prove us right, because for both, the WB and the UN, it begins to be very important during
the third wave of globalization. However, it is important to notice that it started to be more present in the WB annual reports during the 80s,
but for the UN it was not until the 2000.

# Health
The term "health" is another example of our hypothesis of the social issues prevalence during the third wave of globalization. 
However, in this case, the WB started to mention it a lot during the 70s, way before the UN, where it reached its' highest peak at the 2000.
Nevertheless, in both cases, it is more frequent during the last 30 years of the XXth century, providing a reason that supports our hypothesis.

# Climate
Not only social issues were more important during the second wave of globalization, but others also such as climate, proving that a
general perspective shift occurred during in teh WB and the UN the second half of the XXth century in terms of public policy, priorities
and development strategies.
